The many subplots center around a performance of the real-life Ice-Capades skating troupe, featuring such luminaries as Belita, Red McCarthy, Megan Taylor, and future Republic film queen Vera Hruba Ralston. James Ellison plays the nominal leading character, a hotshot newsreel cameraman named Bob Clemens. Assigned to film an international skating star in action, Clemens inadvertently wastes miles of celluloid on aspiring skater Marie (Dorothy Lewis) rather than the real star, the unphotogenic Karen Vajda (Rene Riano). But not to worry: With the help of slick showbiz promoter Larry Herman (Phil Silvers), Marie becomes an Ice-Capades headliner in her own right. In addition to Silvers, the comedy relief in Ice-Capades is in the capable hands of Vera Vague (Barbara Jo Allen), Jerry Colonna and Gus Schilling.","studio":"1","genre":[],"director":[],"role":[],"media":{"bitrate0":1,"aspect_ratio0":1,"audio_channels0":1,"audio_codec0":"1","video_codec0":"1","video_resolution0":"1","video_framerate0":"24p","stream_URL0":"/mnt/gHS.mkv","total_size0":1}},"39581":{"key":39581,"type":"movie","thumb":"/3YVUH52D9NA1NNgPA8pbVGkW3ND.jpg","backdrop":"/txhhvPvSmxSQ40AMFRE2CLSCNFr.jpg","title":"Ice Palace","seasonepisode":"1","duration":1,"view_count":1,"tagline":"1","rating":false,"user_rating":false,"release_year":"1960","release_date":"1960-01-02","addedAt":1,"content_rating":"PG","summary":"Alaska: America's last great wilderness frontier.
