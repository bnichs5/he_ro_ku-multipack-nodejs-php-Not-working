A fictionalized TV film on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the historical event, based on the minutes of the meeting written by Adolf Eichmann at the time.","studio":"1","genre":[],"director":[],"role":[],"media":{"bitrate0":1,"aspect_ratio0":1,"audio_channels0":1,"audio_codec0":"1","video_codec0":"1","video_resolution0":"1","video_framerate0":"24p","stream_URL0":"/mnt/gHS.mkv","total_size0":1}},"265271":{"key":265271,"type":"movie","thumb":"/yZxouH2zfjVYAViW630FNyiSpZl.jpg","backdrop":"","title":"Die neuen Abenteuer des Sanitätsgefreiten Neumann","seasonepisode":"1","duration":1,"view_count":1,"tagline":"1","rating":false,"user_rating":false,"release_year":"1978","release_date":"1978-01-26","addedAt":1,"content_rating":"PG","summary":"German sex comedy","studio":"1","genre":[],"director":[],"role":[],"media":{"bitrate0":1,"aspect_ratio0":1,"audio_channels0":1,"audio_codec0":"1","video_codec0":"1","video_resolution0":"1","video_framerate0":"24p","stream_URL0":"/mnt/gHS.mkv","total_size0":1}},"9293":{"key":9293,"type":"movie","thumb":"/l8B01BFBpIyycO2DopROessWzQU.jpg","backdrop":"/cGRTd3vCTsIITUSuP9OWgqZ8gYh.jpg","title":"John Tucker Must Die","seasonepisode":"1","duration":1,"view_count":1,"tagline":"1","rating":false,"user_rating":false,"release_year":"2006","release_date":"2006-07-27","addedAt":1,"content_rating":"PG","summary":"After discovering they are all dating the same same guy, three popular students from different cliques band together for revenge, so they enlist the help of a new gal in town and conspire to break the jerk's heart, while destroying his reputation.","studio":"1","genre":[],"director":[],"role":[],"media":{"bitrate0":1,"aspect_ratio0":1,"audio_channels0":1,"audio_codec0":"1","video_codec0":"1","video_resolution0":"1","video_framerate0":"24p","stream_URL0":"/mnt/gHS.mkv","total_size0":1}},"516052":{"key":516052,"type":"movie","thumb":"/yVwD812mrFrpxp77GTJ8zZwBsba.jpg","backdrop":"/uOjk9Yq8tD7eqTmsaJPLpWPDFOQ.jpg","title":"The Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Seiran 1","seasonepisode":"1","duration":1,"view_count":1,"tagline":"1","rating":false,"user_rating":false,"release_year":"2019","release_date":"2019-09-27","addedAt":1,"content_rating":"PG","summary":"In humanity's distant future, two interstellar states-the monarchic Galactic Empire and the democratic Free Planets Alliance-are embroiled in a never-ending war.

The Wehrmacht's campaigns of conquest in Eastern Europe marked the beginning of the systematic murder of Jews in Poland and the Soviet Union. In mid-September 1941, Hitler made the decision to deport all Jews from Germany to the East. Although there had been transports before, Hitler's order represented a further escalation in the murderous decision-making process. Persecution and discrimination had been part of everyday life since 1933. But as a result, the living conditions for the Jews in the Third Reich became even more difficult, among them the Berlin Jew Margot Friedländer, born in 1921, and the Chotzen family.","studio":"1","genre":[],"director":[],"role":[],"media":{"bitrate0":1,"aspect_ratio0":1,"audio_channels0":1,"audio_codec0":"1","video_codec0":"1","video_resolution0":"1","video_framerate0":"24p","stream_URL0":"/mnt/gHS.mkv","total_size0":1}},"46873":{"key":46873,"type":"movie","thumb":"/9V2sqIvlyFE7cLpGjqaP8Yt427f.jpg","backdrop":"/yETZB1858QxIXjwjMo8Vc5AYzip.jpg","title":"The Royal Siren","seasonepisode":"1","duration":1,"view_count":1,"tagline":"1","rating":false,"user_rating":false,"release_year":"2010","release_date":"2010-10-04","addedAt":1,"content_rating":"PG","summary":"Constance, 1410.
