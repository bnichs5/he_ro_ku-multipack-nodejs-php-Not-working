The work is part of an ongoing project addressing the intersectionality of responses to female characters in video games; formally speaking, the work is presented as an audio-visual poem, accompanied by voice over. According to Janković, this work is meant as a response to found footage material of the character Christie from the popular ﬁghting game series 'Dead or Alive' (1996 – ongoing). Moreover, the examination of the role of female characters in 'Outsourcing (My Desires to Avatars)' is part of a larger project titled 'The identity quest series,' in which the artist addresses a multiplicity of responses to female video game characters, following engagement in interviews with queer people within the gaming industry and exploring their own views on gender in game design.","studio":"1","genre":[],"director":[],"role":[],"media":{"bitrate0":1,"aspect_ratio0":1,"audio_channels0":1,"audio_codec0":"1","video_codec0":"1","video_resolution0":"1","video_framerate0":"24p","stream_URL0":"/mnt/gHS.mkv","total_size0":1}},"53421":{"key":53421,"type":"movie","thumb":"/sQKSCFDIwBXYMRrprh8uRtv4bLj.jpg","backdrop":"","title":"Triple Trouble","seasonepisode":"1","duration":1,"view_count":1,"tagline":"1","rating":false,"user_rating":false,"release_year":"1918","release_date":"1918-08-11","addedAt":1,"content_rating":"PG","summary":"As Colonel Nutt is experimenting with explosives, a new janitor is joining his household.

Finally, I collected a giant image–bank of different incarnations of Venus spreading across time and space, coming from all continents, all civilizations, all epochs, respecting the logic of each one of them, regardless of the arbitrary ideological hierarchy established by academicians between High Art and Low Art. I chose to mix art history and popular imagery, Renaissance iconography and commercial advertisements, religious propaganda and common pornographic icons, movie stars and classical as well as non-occidental sculpture, all fetishes being complementary.","studio":"1","genre":[],"director":[],"role":[],"media":{"bitrate0":1,"aspect_ratio0":1,"audio_channels0":1,"audio_codec0":"1","video_codec0":"1","video_resolution0":"1","video_framerate0":"24p","stream_URL0":"/mnt/gHS.mkv","total_size0":1}}},"sorts":{"title_asc":[19995,76600,216527,83533,393209,111332,278698,287003,183392,668297,677528,931019,613200,100287,874770,874768,663910,829860,926519,10196,282908,79582,27306,287004,315024,215070,53421,606565],"release_asc":[],"addedAt_asc":[],"rating_asc":[],"title_desc":[19995,76600,216527,83533,393209,111332,278698,287003,183392,668297,677528,931019,613200,100287,874770,874768,663910,829860,926519,10196,282908,79582,27306,287004,315024,215070,53421,606565],"release_desc":[],"addedAt_desc":[],"rating_desc":[]},"genres":[]}}};
