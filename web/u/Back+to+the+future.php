Its facts and component parts have been removed from the depth of their intended context. The resulting re-contextualization is a perversion via production, intended to distort character perspectives. At the same time, this is an exploration of the archetypal relationship that does exist between the narrative of Back to the Future and the 9-11 terror events. The correlations uncovered are meant to indicate a conscious connective fabric that ties together all matter and energy within the universe, producing non-local phenomenon which can be referred to as synchronicity. As this fabric is observed by the characters it chronicles, their own stories will appear to reflect the fabric itself. Be cautious; there is no message here divisible from this medium.","studio":"1","genre":[],"director":[],"role":[],"media":{"bitrate0":1,"aspect_ratio0":1,"audio_channels0":1,"audio_codec0":"1","video_codec0":"1","video_resolution0":"1","video_framerate0":"24p","stream_URL0":"/mnt/gHS.mkv","total_size0":1}},"791264":{"key":791264,"type":"movie","thumb":"/mAsgMCWgiZEtmwVKGsSBfz4EuBa.jpg","backdrop":"","title":"DeLorean: Back from the Future","seasonepisode":"1","duration":1,"view_count":1,"tagline":"1","rating":false,"user_rating":false,"release_year":"2021","release_date":"2021-01-27","addedAt":1,"content_rating":"PG","summary":"John Z DeLorean’s extraordinary and doomed attempt to build the sports car of the future in 1980s Northern Ireland is the stuff of legend.
